### Code Overview
The project is split into two folders, react-app is our front end, and server is our backend

### Installation
```
You will need to open two terminals simultaneously, one for back end and one for the front end.

Install the packages on your machine.
```
npm install
```
start the back end services using the command...
```
node app.js
```
You will then need to go into your second terminal.
Navigate to MovieSearch/react-app
Again, install packages on your machine
```
npm install
```
Finally start the front end using the command...
```
npm run start
```
navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to access the webpage.


The TMDB API is heavily used in this project
